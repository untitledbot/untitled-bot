# Contributing

i'm too lazy to write nice markdown stuff so i'll put it all in a list.

my shift key is not broken btw i just don't like using it.

<li>do not be rude to others.</li>
<li>if you feel like something should be changed, say something (i know my code is garbage).</li>
<li>make sure the contributions are meaningful and improve the bot.</li>
<li>contributions shouldn't violate copyright laws in the united states (and other countries i guess).</li>
<li>check other issues to make sure yours hasn't already been answered (it'll be marked as a duplicate and the original will be linked).</li>
<li>contributions must follow privacy measures as described in the README.</li>
<li>idk just common sense i guess.</li>
