## About self-hosting
The source code is for transparency and contributions.  This bot is not easy to self-host as most of the files are hard-coded
to only listen assuming the bot ID of untitled-bot.

That being said, you can try to self host, but you may not add your self-hosted bot to any bot lists, monetize it, or make it public.

### Contributing

Please help contribute to the bot!  Having multiple people help with the bot makes the repository much better than if
one person did everything.  As of 1.3.21, contributors get a custom background for the `rank` command!
