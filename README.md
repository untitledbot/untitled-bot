## About self-hosting
The source code is for transparency and contributions.  This bot is not easy to self-host as most of the files are hard-coded
to only listen assuming the bot ID of untitled-bot.

That being said, you can try to self host, but you may not add your self-hosted bot to any bot lists, monetize it, or make it public.

### Contributing

Please help contribute to the bot!  Having multiple people help with the bot makes the repository much better than if
one person did everything.

### Note

The bot's code, what is on GitHub, and what is on other branches are async, meaning that there might be features on the bot that aren't on MASTER yet or aren't on GitHub at all.  There might be some features that are on GitHub but are not on the bot.  Check https://top.gg/bot/730135989863055472 for the latest features.
