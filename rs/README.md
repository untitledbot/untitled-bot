# Profile Backgrounds

Profile backgrounds are available to people who make meaningful contributions to untitled-bot.

A meaningful contribution is a new command, exploit or bad bug fixes, or optimization.

New commands and bug fixes apply to issues as well as pull requests.

Please contact me by joining the official Discord server if you have contributed and want your own background.
You will need to have your GitHub integrated with Discord first.

Note: the custom background must fit or be scaled to 800x300 pixels, and must not include any
copyrighted, explicit, or illegal material.  Nothing that could get me or anyone else in
trouble with either GitHub, Discord, or United States law (that last one is unlikely, but I'm
including this just to protect myself).
