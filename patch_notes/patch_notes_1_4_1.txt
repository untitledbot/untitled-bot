Time for part 2/4 of the 1.4 update series.  In this update, the music section got a big improvement!

Changes:
* `play` now supports Spotify, SoundCloud, and Bandcamp, Vimeo, and Twitch.
* `play` no longer filters content based on safe search in NSFW channels.
* servers now have a bigger buffer for music (less stuttering, less lag, more smoothieness:tm:).
* the bot now self-deafens when it plays music in a voice channel (because some people like that)
* prepared the music module for the dashboard on update 4/4.
* owner only commands no longer give any reply if you are not me.
* `permissions` command was re-written to be much cleaner (the old one was practically unusable)

Small changes:
* Updated most dependencies to their latest versions (including Lavaplayer)

Next update:
* Expect some major revisions to economy, specifically more ways to use UB$ and interact with other users.
* `tag` command.
* xp multiplier slider and custom xp per message

See you for update 3/4 in a few days or so!
