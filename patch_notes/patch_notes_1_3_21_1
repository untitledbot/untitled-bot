1.3.21.1

pressed the emergency meeting button because there was an exploit!!!  pretty serious one at that.

users could send logs to different channels in other servers, i needed to fix that asap, as soon as PEW like a bullet, mega supery fast!

anyways that's it, rpg update is still in progress for the three people who care.  the patch notes are available if
you checkout the 1-4-0 branch.  contributors welcome as always.
