version 1.3.19 - the GIF REACTION UPDATE.....

all gif reactions must be provided as links, they are not hard-coded and are not in this repository.

for people who are self-hosting, use this format:
```
untitled-bot
╠ reactions
║ ╠ hug.txt
║ ╠ other.txt
║ ╚ reactions.txt
╠ untitled-bot.jar
╠ bot.properties
╚ etc.
```

non-reaction commands:
* `userinfo` or `info` - get information on a user.  No arguments will get server info.
* `avatar` - get the image avatar of yourself or another user.

reaction commands:
* `hug` - hug another user (or yourself...)
* TODO

other changes:
* the bot will no longer reply to its own mention, instead it will display the prefix.
* annotated the parameters in the method in Command to be org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull.
* prefix can now be up to 5 characters long
* fixed a bug with the `total` and `top` command where it would show a user has 250 extra xp
* added ram stats (really only useful for me) that log total and available ram to a file
* server prefixes are now cached, significantly reducing RAM, disk, and CPU usage.
