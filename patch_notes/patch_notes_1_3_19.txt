alright, i'm starting to like this new format, too bad people who read this on discord and github won't know what i'm talking about.

all gif reactions must be provided as links, they are not hard-coded and are not in this repository.

for people self-hosting, use this format:
```
untitled-bot
╠ reactions
║ ╠ hug.txt
║ ╠ other.txt
║ ╠ reactions.txt
╠ untitled-bot.jar
╠ bot.properties
╚ etc.
```

non-reaction commands:
* `userinfo` or `info` - get information on a user.  No arguments will get server info. TODO
* `ascii` - get info on a specific character or number, see `help ascii`. TODO

reaction commands:
* `hug` - hug another user (you do not need to mention)

other changes:
* the bot will no longer reply to its own mention TODO
* annotated the parameters in the method in Command to be org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull.
