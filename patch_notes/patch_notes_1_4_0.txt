Quality of life changes, as well as updates.

Haven't touched this bot in almost half a year (last update was December 3rd of last year!), but I feel like a few small updates are going to be easier than one big update, especially when I feel like working on the dashboard for the bot (it's coming soon:tm:)

Since JDA 4.3.0 came out recently, I have added buttons to untitled-bot!  You may see them on command responses, especially music commands.

New things:
* `rank-bg` - change your rank card background.
* `rank-color` - change your rank card color.

Updates:
* Added buttons to `play` and some other commands.
* Prefix can no longer start with `<` or contain `\`
* `top` no longer has a "last updated" message on the bottom and doesn't display discriminator.
* `top` also has a reduced cooldown (2 minutes instead of 10).
* updated `now-playing` to make it look nicer on some devices.
* `si` now lists `members` instead of `users`

Bug fixes:
* `queue` no longer errors if there are no upcoming songs.
* Queue empty message no longer displays "Music Player" twice.
