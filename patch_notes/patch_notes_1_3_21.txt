multi-language support will come later, i underestimated how big of an update that will be

new things:
* `discord` - get an invite link for the Discord server.
* `vote` - get the vote link for the bot.
* `ping` - get the ping of the bot.
* `bal` or `balance` - get your (or another users) balance for the bot (not the same as XP).  TODO
* `shop` - list the shop or buy items.
* `work`, `steal`, and `bet` - earn or lose money depending on the command (and your luck :P).  TODO
* `inv` - list your inventory.
* `reverse` - reverse a string. 
* there was probably something else i did i forgot to document.

bug fixes:
* `help` command now displays the discord server link like it should.
* `timestamp` command no longer displays gray when it gets a timestamp.  its now a happy green instead of sad gray.
* rank roles might not be assigned for some reason.  if you still have problems, please report them using `bug-report`.
* the text in the `info` command is now much easier to read on mobile (title of fields is bold).

other things:
* i have made a LOT OF DOCUMENTATION for the bot.  comments everywhere.  just wanted to do that before i forgot what stuff did.
* commands now display the timestamp thing.
* `status` displays a lot more stuff now.

TODO UPDATE SITE
TODO UPDATE ALL COMMANDS
TODO UPDATE README
