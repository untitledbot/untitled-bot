multi-language support will come later, i underestimated how big of an update that will be

BEFORE ANYTHING...
new site: untitled-bot.xyz

also i just kept piling stuff on for this update and i think i need to cool down on how much stuff is done in one update.

new things:
* `discord` - get an invite link for the Discord server.
* `vote` - get the vote link for the bot.
* `ping` - get the ping of the bot.
* `bal` or `balance` - get your (or another users) balance for the bot (not the same as XP).
* `shop` - list the shop or buy items.
* `work`, `steal`, and `bet` - earn or lose money depending on the command (and your luck :P).TODO and TODO test work min higher than max
* `inv` - list your inventory.
* `reverse` - reverse a string.
* `days-until <yyyy> <mm> <dd>` - days until a specific date.  yes, i'm forcing iso 8601.TODO
* `time <command>` - time a command.TODO
* `config` - central configuration for the bot.TODO
* `item` - use an item in your inventory.TODO
* added an `xp voucher` item that can be used with the item.
* there was probably something else i did i forgot to document.

bug fixes:
* `help` command now displays the discord server link like it should.
* `timestamp` command no longer displays gray when it gets a timestamp.  its now a happy green instead of sad gray.
* rank roles might not be assigned for some reason.  if you still have problems, please report them using `bug-report`.
* the text in the `info` command is now much easier to read on mobile (title of fields is bold).
* commands no longer reward XP.  it wasn't really a bug but i've been meaning to change this for a while now.
* ranking now awards 0 to 7 xp instead of 3 to 5.  this should make it a bit more luck based.

other things:
* i have made a LOT OF DOCUMENTATION for the bot.  comments everywhere.  just wanted to do that before i forgot what stuff did.
* commands now display the timestamp thing as well as the mod logs.
* `status` displays a lot more stuff now.
* `top` command now allows you to input 10 to 50 people to display instead of always 10.  `top [#]`
* i didn't test the command above so please let me know if it's broken or something thanks
* `vr` and `daily` command now give you untitled-bot currency instead of XP.
* README now has an invite link for the bot because it actually needs it lol
* `level` is now an alias for `rank`.
* `brainfuck` now uses standard input (comma) to be fully compliant with the language.
* i have unified the description of the bot on ALL SITES..... i needed to do that as there was a lot of outdated stuff.TODO

TODO UPDATE SITE
TODO UPDATE ALL COMMANDS
TODO UPDATE README
TODO UPDATE TOP.GG
TODO UPDATE OTHER SITES
TODO MAKE SECOND JAR WITH PATCH FOR WORK COMMAND

so this is just notes for me pls do not commit this
the config easy thing will be like this
`config opt:val;opt:val;opt:val;opt:val`
makes it a lot easier to quickly setup the things.

oops i committed it just don't include it in the patch notes
