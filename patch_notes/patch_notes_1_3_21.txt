multi-language support will come later, i underestimated how big of an update that will be

new things:
* `cron <dm | channel #> <@join | @leave | m h d m w> <message...>` - set a cron to send messages at intervals (dm only supports @join and @leave). TODO
* `crons` - list cron jobs, there will be a limit of 10 cron jobs per server (to reduce server load on my end ;-;) TODO
* `cron-del <cron #>` - delete a cron job number as listed in `crons`. TODO
* `craft <recipe | skin> <item | username>` - get the minecraft crafting recipe of an item or skin of a user. TODO
* `discord` - get an invite link for the Discord server. TODO
* `vote` - get the vote link for the bot. TODO

bug fixes:
* `help` command now displays the discord server link like it should.
* `timestamp` command no longer displays gray when it gets a timestamp. TODO

other things:
* i have made a LOT OF DOCUMENTATION for the bot.  comments everywhere.  just wanted to do that before i forgot what stuff did.
