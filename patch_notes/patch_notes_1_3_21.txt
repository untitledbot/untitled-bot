multi-language support will come later, i underestimated how big of an update that will be

new things:
* `discord` - get an invite link for the Discord server.
* `vote` - get the vote link for the bot.
* `ping` - get the ping of the bot.
* `bal` or `balance` - get your (or another users) balance for the bot (not the same as XP).
* `shop` - list the shop or buy items.
* `work`, `steal`, and `bet` - earn or lose money depending on the command (and your luck :P).  TODO
* `inv` - list your inventory.
* `reverse` - reverse a string.
* `days-until <yyyy> <mm> <dd>` - days until a specific date.  yes, i'm forcing iso 8601.TODO
* `config` - central configuration for the bot.TODO
* the site now has a spot to generate single-command `config` commands for quick server setup.TODO
* there was probably something else i did i forgot to document.

bug fixes:
* `help` command now displays the discord server link like it should.
* `timestamp` command no longer displays gray when it gets a timestamp.  its now a happy green instead of sad gray.
* rank roles might not be assigned for some reason.  if you still have problems, please report them using `bug-report`.
* the text in the `info` command is now much easier to read on mobile (title of fields is bold).

other things:
* i have made a LOT OF DOCUMENTATION for the bot.  comments everywhere.  just wanted to do that before i forgot what stuff did.
* commands now display the timestamp thing as well as the mod logs.
* `status` displays a lot more stuff now.
* `top` command now allows you to input 10 to 50 people to display instead of always 10.  `top [#]`
* i didn't test the command above so please let me know if it's broken or something thanks
* `vr` and `daily` command now give you untitled-bot currency instead of XP.
* README now has an invite link for the bot because it actually needs it lol
* `level` is now an alias for `rank`.

TODO UPDATE SITE
TODO UPDATE ALL COMMANDS
TODO UPDATE README

so this is just notes for me pls do not commit this
the config easy thing will be like this
`config opt:val;opt:val;opt:val;opt:val`
makes it a lot easier to quickly setup the things.
