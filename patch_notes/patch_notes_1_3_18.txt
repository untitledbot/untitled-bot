why was i not doing patch notes in their own files
anyways i said that 1.3.16 was the last until the rpg but that's going to be a while for 1.4 so i'm still going to
make more updates and work on the rpg in its own branch

this is going to be a sort of big release so hold on tight

new features:
* `owo` command - make a stwing vewy cute and owo wike,,,,,
* `uptime` command - get the uptime of the bot in milliseconds
* the `timestamp` command now accepts channel # and user @ for timestamps as well as snowflakes and has a better help message
* the `help` command now displays actually useful information
* `commands` no longer DMs and is much more compact with more info
* the `status` command no longer fetches info on-command, it updates every three minutes
* dropped some unnecessary stats from `status`
* the `about` command now lists info about the bot instead of garbage that is unusable
* removed the RPG shop items (will come back in the future)

everything was really just cleaned up and it's a big quality of life update.

planned features:
* `hug`, `pat`, and other commands to spawn anime GIFs to use as reactions
* TODO insert super cool feature here
