the update that does some things number twelve or something i lost track

this update is really just a performance boost.
i also updated the website to make it not a blob of text, check it out:
https://alexisok.dev/untitled-bot

changes:
* bot now sends a message when it joins a guild.
* guild member join now displays account creation time
* bot now communicates with top.gg for server count
* the bot now tells you how much time to wait for your daily reward
* update README to remove plugin stuff.  there will not be plugin support for external jars.  sorry.
* `rank-role <level> <role @ | role ID | role name | none>` - have server admins set this up to give specific roles on specific levels!
* `rank-roles` - list the rank roles.
* `help` command no longer displays the permission node of the command.
* `uptime` command displays days and hours instead of milliseconds
* `vote-reward` or `vr` - get bonus XP for voting for the bot (1000 on normal days, 4000 on double vote weekend).
* `timestamp` command now defaults to the server creation time instead of the help page.
* `bug-report <content>` - report bugs directly to me (delay of 24 hours between bug reports).

bug fixes:
* user leaving voice channel uses the correct color (red) instead of the one used for joining a voice channel (green) (yes, i did copy paste code).
* log checking could produce NullPointerException, filling up the logs.  i have fixed this by literally moving one line of code.  wait what did i change i forgot oops
* `dis` command now shows the face without an embed.
* user nickname change no longer shows `null` if the user did not previously have a nickname.
* `avatar` command is now on the website and README, it was already in all commands...

future things:
* multi-language support (bot can have its language changed to accommodate different languages).
* `lang` command to change the language.
* if you speak other languages, especially ones that are common, please help translate :) (i only speak english).
* `cron <dm | channel #> <@join | @leave | m h d m w> <message...>` - set a cron to send messages at intervals (dm only supports @join and @leave).
* `crons` - list cron jobs, there will be a limit of 10 cron jobs per server (to reduce server load on my end ;-;)
* `cron-del <cron #>` - delete a cron job number as listed in `crons`.
* `craft <recipe | skin> <item | username>` - get the minecraft crafting recipe of an item or skin of a user.

anyways
