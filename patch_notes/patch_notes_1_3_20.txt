the update that does some things number twelve or something i lost track

this update is really just a performance boost.
i also updated the website to make it not a blob of text, check it out:
https://alexisok.dev/untitled-bot

changes:
* bot now sends a message when it joins a guild
* guild member join now displays account creation time
* bot now communicates with top.gg for server count TODO
* the bot now tells you how much time to wait for your daily reward TODO
* update README to remove plugin stuff.  there will not be plugin support for external jars.  sorry.
* `rank-role <level> <role @ | role ID | role name | none>` - have server admins set this up to give specific roles on specific levels! TODO
* `rank-roles` - list the rank roles. TODO
* `timezone <utc offset> <server | me>` - set your timezone offset from utc. ex. `timezone +1:00` or `timezone -4:30`.  Must be within 24 hours of utc.  TODO
* `timestamp` command now adjusts for timezone TODO
* sharding - the program is NO LONGER SINGLE THREADED!!!!! this took forever, why didn't i just do this in the first place? TODO


bug fixes:
* user leaving voice channel uses the correct color (red) instead of the one used for joining a voice channel (green) (yes, i did copy paste)
* 

future things:
* multi-language support (bot can have its language changed to accommodate different languages)
* `lang` command to change the language
* if you speak other languages, especially ones that are common, please help translate :) (i only speak english)
