After almost two months of doing literally nothing with this bot, I am working on it again... sort of.

I am implementing Xignotic's API (shiro.gg), though the bot will NOT have any of the NSFW commands.

I am also disabling the level up messages unless people specify that they want them.  Existing servers
will have level up messages enabled.

These servers that added the bot early are going to be called legacy servers, and they will have all vote-locked commands
enabled for free for users in the server :D

New things:
* `snipe-vc` - get the last person who left a voice chat.TODO
* PLEASE SEE `>help anime` FOR THE NEW SHIRO.GG COMMANDS.  there are 12 of them and i don't feel like copy/pasting them here.
* oh yeah I ADDDED A WEB DASHBOARD FINALLY took long enough.TODO

Updated things:
* Level up messages are now disabled by default except for existing servers.
* Vote locked commands are given to any existing server without requiring their users to vote.TODO
* Starboard will now star embeds properly.TODO
* `<` is NO LONGER allowed as a prefix.  thanks to a specific server for setting it to this and filling up my logs :angeryBOYE:.TODO
* updated dependencies to newer versions, the bot is now using JDA 4.2.0_228.

Bug fixes:
* Some places in the bot suggested that YT search wasn't a thing when it has been for months.
* YT error messages now display actual errors rather than nothing.TODO
* `rank` will now correctly get users by their effective name.

Bot switching from .properties files to SQL never:tm:
