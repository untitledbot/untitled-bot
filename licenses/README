The licenses in this directory references programs or code that are under
licenses that state that a copy of the license must be distributed alongside
the distributed program.

I'm not sure if I need to do this since the program I used was an action,
though it is best to provide credit regardless.

"build-number" and the license from that come from
https://github.com/einaregilsson/build-number
